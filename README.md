## Surf and Shake Shop
  After my recent visit to O'ahu I discovered that I never wnated to leave. So after many ideas I settled on one that would make both my soul and body happy. A surfing and ice cream business! Now all I needed was the capital. I found an investor, W. Avy, that had the same love for both surfing and ice cream but he wasn't as ready as I was to dive head first. He wanted to know the avg temperatures for both June and December inorder to see if the business could operate year round.
