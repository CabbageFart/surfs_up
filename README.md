## Surf and Shake Shop
  After my recent visit to O'ahu I discovered that I never wnated to leave. So after many ideas I settled on one that would make both my soul and body happy. A surfing and ice cream business! Now all I needed was the capital. I found an investor, W. Avy, that had the same love for both surfing and ice cream but he wasn't as ready as I was to dive head first. He wanted to know the avg temperatures for both June and December inorder to see if the business could operate year round.

## Results
### How's the Weather
  * I gathered data from the sqlite file produced by the weather stations located around the island. Nine stations in all.

  * Using my Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy skills I was ta able to extract the temperatures from both June and December.

  * After gathering up this data I converted everything over to a pandas dataframe. Which in turn allowed me to easily get the max, min, and mean temps for both months.
